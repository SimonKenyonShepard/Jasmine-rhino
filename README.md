=============

Jasmine Rhino command line runner


This project has a working version of Jasmine and Env.js running under Rhino with the console output reporter and a modification to exit with the correct exit code if there are more than 0 failures for easy Jenkins intergration. 

To run it clone it and from the linux commandline run ./run.sh.
